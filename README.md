# PythonAutomation
## So the idea behind this project is to create a web App that is based on Python that is able to automate tasks on google docs  
One of the frequent tasks that I love doing is having a gratitude Journal, the mobile app is great but the fact that I cannot back up anything is the part 
I wouldn't say I like it. I can quickly lose my phone and will probably;y lose my data along with it. 
so for that reason, automation using google docs is really exciting 
#### I will be listing project automation ideas for the next few days.
#### Top of the list will probably be Python Youtube view count update
##### More ideas are still being explored
