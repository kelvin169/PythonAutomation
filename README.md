# PythonAutomation
## So the idea behind this project is to create a web App that is based on python that is able to automate tasks on googledocs  
One of the frequent task that I love doing is having a gratitude Journal , the mobile app is greate but the fact that I cannot back up anything is the part 
I really do not like . I can easily lose my phone and will probab;y lose my data along with it. 
### so for that reason automation using google docs is really exciting 
### I will be listing project automation ideas for the next few days.
#### Top of the list will probably be python Youtube viewcount update.
##### More ideas are still being explore.
